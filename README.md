## Hi there!

I'm an experienced front-end developer with more than 15 years of expertise in web and mobile development, specializing in e-commerce products. I have a strong foundation in best practices such as pair programming, code reviewing, refactoring, and unit testing. Troubleshooting and debugging are also some of my strongest skills.

I am passionate about constantly exploring new technologies and working collaboratively with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures. Throughout my career, I have worked with several large companies in the e-commerce industry and have gained a deep understanding of the complexities involved in developing and maintaining successful e-commerce products.
